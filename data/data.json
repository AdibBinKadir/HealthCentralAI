If you've been trained, apply a splint to the area above and below the fracture sites.\n3. Apply ice packs to limit swelling and help relieve pain. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.\n4. Treat for shock. If the person feels faint, lay them down with the head slightly lower than the trunk and elevate the legs if possible."]
